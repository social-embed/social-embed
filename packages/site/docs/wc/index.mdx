`<o-embed>` is a [web component] to automatically switch out tags with
[oEmbed]-compatible social websites. You can it anywhere you can use HTML!

Under the hood, this embed doesn't use oEmbed directly, rather, it uses [`@social-embed/lib`]'s
repository of patterns and functions to fetch the ID and translate the URL into a compatible format.

The reason this works is providers like YouTube, Vimeo, and so on are inclined to keep embed
formats stable (so existing embeds across the web don't break).

The component is built in [LitElement] w/ [lit-html] + [TypeScript]. [View the source](https://github.com/social-embed/social-embed/tree/master/packages/wc) on GitHub.

## Usecases

- Dynamic content backends
  - users enter a media URL, such as a YouTube link
  - HTML content where embeds are saved
- HTML Editors
  This package was originally created for [CKEditor]'s [`MediaEmbed`] module (see issue [ckeditor#2737])
- Also common is detecting if a URL is embeddable or not, in that case see [`@social-embed/lib`]

## Try it live

`<o-embed>` can handle simple embeds with _open_ embedding, such as YouTube, DailyMotion,
Vimeo, and Spotify.

```jsx live
<o-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd8_vO5zrjo"></o-embed>
```

### Declarative rendering

`<o-embed>` can be used with declarative rendering libraries like Angular, React, Vue, and lit-html

```js
import {html, render} from 'lit-html';

const url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLOCQw5s9Uw';

render(
  html`
    <h2>This is an &lt;o-embed&gt;</h2>
    <o-embed .url=${url}></o-embed>
  `,
  document.body
);
```

<h2>This is an &lt;o-embed&gt;</h2>
<o-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLOCQw5s9Uw"></o-embed>
